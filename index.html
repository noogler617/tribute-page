    <h3>Here is a timeline of Carl Sagan's amazing story.</h3>

      <li><strong>High school years: </strong>Carl Sagan was a straight A student, found himself bored with class and that his teachers were uninspiring.
      Before the end of high school, he entered an essay contest in which he posed the question
      of whether human contact with advanced life forms from another planet might be as disastrous for people on
      Earth as it was for Native Americans when they first had contact with Europeans. The subject was considered controversial, but his rhetorical skill won over the judges, and they awarded him first prize.
      By graduation, his classmates had voted him "most likely to succeed" and put him in line to be valedictorian. </li>

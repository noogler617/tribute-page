    <!--Life Story -->
    <h3>Here is a timeline of Carl Sagan's amazing story.</h3>
    <ul id="tribute-info">
      <li><strong>Born: </strong>November 9th, 1934 Brooklyn New York</li><br />

      <li><strong>High school years: </strong>Carl Sagan was a straight A student, found himself bored with class and that his teachers were uninspiring.
      Before the end of high school, he entered an essay contest in which he posed the question
      of whether human contact with advanced life forms from another planet might be as disastrous for people on
      Earth as it was for Native Americans when they first had contact with Europeans. The subject was considered controversial, but his rhetorical skill won over the judges, and they awarded him first prize.
      By graduation, his classmates had voted him "most likely to succeed" and put him in line to be valedictorian. </li><br>

      <li><strong>University Year's: </strong>Carl Sagan attend the University of Chicago where he earned his B.A. B.S. M.S. PhD.</li><br>

      <li><strong>Career: </strong>Sagan lectured, performed research, and advised graduate students at Harvard's University institution from 1963 until 1968,
      as well as working at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, also located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</li><br>

      <li>In 1968, Sagan was denied tenure at Harvard. </li><br>

      <li>Long before the ill-fated tenure process, Cornell University astronomer Thomas Gold had courted Sagan to move to Ithaca, New York, and join the faculty at Cornell.
        Following the denial of tenure from Harvard, Sagan accepted Gold's offer and remained a faculty member at Cornell for nearly 30 years until his death in 1996.
        Unlike Harvard, the smaller and more laid-back astronomy department at Cornell welcomed Sagan's growing celebrity status.
        Following two years as an associate professor, Sagan became a full professor at Cornell in 1970 and directed the Laboratory for Planetary Studies there.
         From 1972 to 1981, he was associate director of the Center for Radiophysics and Space Research (CRSR) at Cornell. In 1976, he became the David Duncan Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences, a position he held for the remainder of his life.</li>
<br>
      <li><strong>TV Series: Cosmos</strong><br>
        In 1980 Sagan co-wrote and narrated the award-winning 13-part PBS television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, which became the most widely watched series in the history of American public television.
        The show has been seen by at least 500 million people across 60 different countries.
        The book, Cosmos, written by Sagan, was published to accompany the series.
      </li><br>

      <li><strong>Scientific Research: </strong><br>
        Sagan was a proponent of the search for extraterrestrial life. He urged the scientific community to listen with radio telescopes for signals from potential intelligent extraterrestrial life-forms.
        Sagan was so persuasive that by 1982 he was able to get a petition advocating SETI published in the journal Science, signed by 70 scientists, including seven Nobel Prize winners.
        This signaled a tremendous increase in the respectability of a then-controversial field. Sagan also helped Frank Drake write the Arecibo message, a radio message beamed into
        space from the Arecibo radio telescope on November 16, 1974, aimed at informing potential extraterrestrials about Earth.

      <li><strong>Personal Life</strong><br>
        He lived in an Egyptian revival house in Ithaca perched on the edge of a cliff that had formerly been the headquarters of a Cornell secret society.
        <br />
        Sagan's interest in UFO reports prompted him on August 3, 1952, to write a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson to ask how the United States would respond if flying saucers turned out to be extraterrestrial.
        He later had several conversations on the subject in 1964 with Jacques Vall√©e. Though quite skeptical of any extraordinary answer to the UFO question, Sagan thought scientists should study the phenomenon, at least because there was widespread public interest
        in UFO reports.

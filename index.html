    <!--Life Story -->
    <h3>Here is a timeline of Carl Sagan's amazing story.</h3>
    <ul id="tribute-info">
      <li><strong>Born: </strong>November 9th, 1934 Brooklyn New York</li>

      <li><strong>High school years: </strong>Carl Sagan was a straight A student, found himself bored with class and that his teachers were uninspiring.
      Before the end of high school, he entered an essay contest in which he posed the question
      of whether human contact with advanced life forms from another planet might be as disastrous for people on
      Earth as it was for Native Americans when they first had contact with Europeans. The subject was considered controversial, but his rhetorical skill won over the judges, and they awarded him first prize.
      By graduation, his classmates had voted him "most likely to succeed" and put him in line to be valedictorian. </li>

      <li><strong>University Year's </strong>Carl Sagan attend the University of Chicago where he earned his B.A. B.S. M.S. PhD.</li>

      <li><strong>Career: </strong>Sagan lectured, performed research, and advised graduate students at Harvard's University institution from 1963 until 1968,
      as well as working at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, also located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</li>

      <li>In 1968, Sagan was denied tenure at Harvard. </li>

      <li>Long before the ill-fated tenure process, Cornell University astronomer Thomas Gold had courted Sagan to move to Ithaca, New York, and join the faculty at Cornell.
        Following the denial of tenure from Harvard, Sagan accepted Gold's offer and remained a faculty member at Cornell for nearly 30 years until his death in 1996.
        Unlike Harvard, the smaller and more laid-back astronomy department at Cornell welcomed Sagan's growing celebrity status.
        Following two years as an associate professor, Sagan became a full professor at Cornell in 1970 and directed the Laboratory for Planetary Studies there.
         From 1972 to 1981, he was associate director of the Center for Radiophysics and Space Research (CRSR) at Cornell. In 1976, he became the David Duncan Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences, a position he held for the remainder of his life.</li>

      <li><strong>TV Series: Cosmos</strong>
        In 1980 Sagan co-wrote and narrated the award-winning 13-part PBS television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, which became the most widely watched series in the history of American public television.
        The show has been seen by at least 500 million people across 60 different countries.
        The book, Cosmos, written by Sagan, was published to accompany the series.
